abstract={The origin and turnover of efferent populations of mouse mononuclear phagocytes has been described. Mononuclear phagocytes were defined as mononuclear cells which are able to adhere to glass and phagocytize. In vitro labeling studies with thymidine-3H showed that monocytes in the peripheral blood and peritoneal macrophages do not multiply and can be considered end cells in a normal, steady state situation. However, the mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow appear to be rapidly dividing cells. This conclusion was supported by in vivo labeling experiments. A peak of labeled mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow was found 24 hr after a pulse of thymidine-3H. This was followed, 24 hr later, by a peak of labeled monocytes in the peripheral blood. From these experiments it was concluded that the rapidly dividing mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow, called promonocytes, are the progenitor cells of the monocytes. Labeling studies after splenectomy and after X-irradiation excluded other organs as a major source of the monocytes. Peak labeling of both the blood monocyte and peritoneal macrophages occurred at the same time. A rapid entry of monocytes from the blood into the peritoneal cavity was observed, after a sterile inflammation was evoked by an injection of newborn calf serum. These data have led to the conclusion that monocytes give rise to peritoneal macrophages. No indications have been obtained that mononuclear phagocytes originate from lymphocytes. In the normal steady state the monocytes leave the circulation by a random process, with a half-time of 22 hr. The average blood transit time of the monocytes has been calculated to be 32 hr. The turnover rate of peritoneal macrophages was low and estimated at about 0.1{\%} per hour. On the basis of these studies the life history of mouse mononuclear phagocytes was formulated to be: promonocytes in the bone marrow, {\textrightarrow} monocytes in the peripheral blood, {\textrightarrow} macrophages in the tissue.},

abstract={Abstract In murine ontogeny, macrophage precursor cells develop in the yolk sac and fetal liver. Primitive macrophages also appear in the yolk sac, migrate to various tissues, and differentiate into several fetal macrophage populations. Because the development of the monocytic cell lineage is incomplete in the early stage of fetal hematopoiesis, primitive/fetal macrophages are considered to originate from granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells or earlier macrophage precursors, bypassing the early monocytic cell series. In adult mice rendered severely monocytopenic by administration of strontium-89, resident macrophages are maintained by self-renewal. In contrast, administration of liposome-encapsulated dichloromethylene diphosphonate (clodronate) results in the elimination of various tissue macrophage populations. The repopulation of affected macrophages is dependent on the increase of precursors in the liver and spleen during the period of macrophage depletion. Such precursors reconstitute heterogeneous macrophage subpopulations. In mice homozygous for the osteopetrosis (op) mutation, the absence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) activity results in a deficiency of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. However, immature macrophages are present in various tissues. Administration of M-CSF to op/op mice induces the increased proliferative capacity and the morphological maturation of macrophages. However, the responses of individual tissue macrophage subpopulations to M-CSF are different. These results indicate that macrophage development, differentiation, and proliferation are regulated by the tissue microenvironment including the in situ production of macrophage growth factors in both fetal and adult life.},

   Abstract={Peripheral blood monocytes are a heterogeneous population of circulating leukocytes. Using a murine adoptive transfer system to probe monocyte homing and differentiation in vivo, we identified two functional subsets among murine blood monocytes: a short-lived CX(3)CR1(lo)CCR2(+)Gr1(+) subset that is actively recruited to inflamed tissues and a CX(3)CR1(hi)CCR2(-)Gr1(-) subset characterized by CX(3)CR1-dependent recruitment to noninflamed tissues. Both subsets have the potential to differentiate into dendritic cells in vivo. The level of CX(3)CR1 expression also defines the two major human monocyte subsets, the CD14(+)CD16(-) and CD14(lo)CD16(+) monocytes, which share phenotype and homing potential with the mouse subsets. These findings raise the potential for novel therapeutic strategies in inflammatory diseases.},

The factors regulating LC homeostasis remain elusive and the direct circulating LC precursor has not yet been identified in vivo. Here we report an absence of LCs in mice deficient in the receptor for colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) in steady-state conditions. Using bone marrow chimeric mice, we have established that CSF-1 receptor--deficient hematopoietic precursors failed to reconstitute the LC pool in inflamed skin. Furthermore, monocytes with high expression of the monocyte marker Gr-1 (also called Ly-6c/G) were specifically recruited to the inflamed skin, proliferated locally and differentiated into LCs. These results identify Gr-1hi monocytes as the direct precursors for LCs in vivo and establish the importance of the CSF-1 receptor in this process.},

The factors controlling microglia recruitment from the blood remain elusive and the direct circulating microglia precursor has not yet been identified in vivo. Using a panel of bone marrow chimeric and adoptive transfer experiments, we found that circulating Ly-6ChiCCR2+ monocytes were preferentially recruited to the lesioned brain and differentiated into microglia. Notably, microglia engraftment in CNS pathologies, which are not associated with overt blood-brain barrier disruption, required previous conditioning of brain (for example, by direct tissue irradiation). Our results identify Ly-6ChiCCR2+ monocytes as direct precursors of microglia in the adult brain and establish the importance of local factors in the adult CNS for microglia engraftment.},

However, some macrophages develop in the embryo before the appearance of definitive HSCs. We thus reinvestigated macrophage development. We found that the transcription factor Myb was required for development of HSCs and all CD11bhigh monocytes and macrophages, but was dispensable for yolk sac (YS) macrophages and for the development of YS-derived F4/80bright macrophages in several tissues, such as liver Kupffer cells, epidermal Langerhans cells, and microglia - cell populations that all can persist in adult mice independently of HSCs. These results define a lineage of tissue macrophages that derive from the YS and are genetically distinct from HSC progeny.},

During both homeostasis and inflammation, circulating monocytes leave the bloodstream and migrate into tissues where, following conditioning by local growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines and microbial products, they differentiate into macrophage or dendritic cell populations. Recruitment of monocytes is essential for effective control and clearance of viral, bacterial, fungal and protozoal infections, but recruited monocytes also contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and degenerative diseases.
